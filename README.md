#  Movie Library — Web Application
Minimalist Node.js & Express.js web application serving as a prototype for a movie catalog website.

Movie Library is a clean and simple web application built using Node.js and Express.js.
It demonstrates basic server setup, static file handling, and a well-organized project structure.
Perfect as a starting point for adding movie data, multiple pages, or API functionality.
